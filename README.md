# rust-middleware

Designing middleware for robotics communication similar to ROS. This middleware should be to handle modular pub-sub communication between distributed components in order to improve my understanding of both ROS and Rust. 

Rust's abstractions and ownership model will help ensure safe message passing and deterministic performance which is key for improving reliability in a real-time system.
